As you plan your travels to Uganda, please monitor the COVID-19 situation using [this link]( https://www.google.com/search?q=Uganda+Covid+Data&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS958US959&oq=Uganda+&aqs=chrome.0.69i59l2j69i57j0i67i433j69i60l4.5705j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)


The biggest challenge that remains for Uganda is low vaccination rates, where the reported vaccinated persons is less than 0.01% . The hope is that there will be more  equitable access to the vaccines and help tackle the pandemic as more vaccine donations come from China, Europe, and the USA.
