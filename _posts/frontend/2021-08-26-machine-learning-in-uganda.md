As Uganda continues to grow in population, especially its youth, there is a need for growth in technology to be able to utilize human capital. In addition, Uganda is rich  in natural resources and there is increasing data from several sectors such as tourism, healthcare sector, and communication and transportation, among others, yet this data is never used to make real world solutions and create efficient processes and services. For example, the  agriculture sector, which is the backbone of  Uganda’s economy, still relies on rudimentary methods which have led to continued reduction in production. 

Although Uganda is one of the most entrepreneurial countries in the world, most businesses end up dying within fewer than three years due lack of innovation. Thus, there is a need to pursue ardent and edge-cutting research, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning models that will make services more affordable, inclusive, and sustainable. 

LAPO Solutions LTD is focused on helping both individuals and businesses, especially Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), achieve their potential by using Machine Learning and AI to equip these SMEs with analytics, knowledge, research, skills, and tools that are needed to transform Uganda and be able to meet today’s working world.
